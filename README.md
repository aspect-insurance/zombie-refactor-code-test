# Bertie Code Challenge

OH NO! Your junior developer has written a sub par codebase for our new Zombie Insurance Platform.

Have a look through, note any potential mistakes you can see and refactor them away.

## Setup

This is a Vite/React & Express codebase.

To get going, simply run `npm i` and `npm run dev`

## Scope

- Anything in the components/ui folder is from the Shadcn UI library and you do not have to touch
- data.ts in server should not be changed
